# Conclusion

The first step in developing a Dapp is to deploy the smart contracts. _Chinstrap_ takes LIGO/SmartPy code and deploys it onto any public or private network. Each origination needs an initial storage that is compliant with the storage type of Michelson code.

Thanks to its easy configuration and readable origination files, _Chinstrap_ is an essential tool throughout the development and deployment of a Dapp.
