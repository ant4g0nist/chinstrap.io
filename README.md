## Start dev server for maintaining purpose

You will need Node.js (version 14, as newer versions are not supported by our hosting platform at the moment) to run the site locally.  
Using [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm#intro) is the recommended way to install such a version. Once it is installed, you can run the following commands:

-   `nvm install 14 && nvm use 14` - installs Node.js v14
-   `npm i` - installs the Node.js dependencies
-   `npm run dev` - starts the local development server

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the local website.
