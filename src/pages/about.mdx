# Introduction

I'm Chai. I am the creator of Chinstrap and the founder and CEO of <a href='hwefuzz.io'>WeFuzz</a>. In the middle of last year, I built and released Chinstrap's initial version. I was approached by a few members of the Tezos community asking to work more, and the Tezos community provided me with some helpful feedback. Based on that, I applied for Tezos Foundation Grant and started concentrating more on Chinstrap. This March, Chinstrap was awarded a generous grant from Tezos Foundation. ðŸŽŠðŸŽŠðŸŽŠ

Announcing <a href='https://forum.tezosagora.org/t/announcing-chinstrap-a-swiss-army-knife-for-all-tezos-smart-contract-developers/4359'>Chinstrap</a>: A Swiss-Army-Knife for all Tezosâ€™ Smart Contract developers.

## Chinstrap

Chinstrap is a development environment, testing framework, and asset pipeline focused solely on Tezos, aiming to become Swiss-Army-Knife for Tezos Smart Contract developers.

\
&nbsp;

Chinstrap makes Tezos developers' life easy by providing support for multiple contract compilations, tests, and originations on public and private Tezos networks.

- Github: <a href='https://github.com/ant4g0nist/chinstrap'>ant4g0nist/chinstrap</a>: A development environment, testing framework, and origination pipeline focused solely on Tezos 16

## Features

Chinstrap offers:

- End-to-end build cycle support for Creation, Compilation, Testing, and Origination of Smart Contracts
- Local sandbox environment to develop and test contracts
- Support for coding tests in Python and testing with Pytest/SmartPy
- Support for coding smart contracts and tests in Ligo
- Support for coding smart contracts in Ligo and tests in Pytest
- Scriptable deployment & originations framework
- Originations Management for deploying to many public & private networks
- Interactive debug console to debug and directly communicate with contracts
- Support for SmartPy and Ligo development environment
- Clear documentation for developersï¿¼

### Why Chinstrap?
Here are some reasons why I built Chinstrap:

- Lack of development framework that focuses on Tezos Smart Contract development
- Lack of easy to use Tezos Smart Contract life cycle management
- Lack of automated contract testing setup

### Goals
- Development framework that solely focuses on Tezos Environment
- Support and improve smart contract life cycle management framework on multiple networks
- Support for multiple python testing setups
- Support for coding smart contracts and tests in Ligo
- Support for coding smart contracts in Ligo and tests in Pytest
- Support for contracts and tests in Ligo
- Support for basic required Security tests
- Improve Sandbox integrations
- Improve SmartPy Compilations
- Improve SmartPy tests, and Pytest tests setups
- Improve repl experience
- Improve documentation
- Visual studio code plugin
- Add tests for Chinstrap
- Add debugging support for Michelin code


## What will I be working on?

#### Milestone 1
- Support the latest protocol updates of the Tezos protocol on Chinstrap.
- Support and facilitate the programming of smart contracts and respective tests in Ligo.
- Ongoing maintenance of the platform.

#### Milestone 2
- Improve, update, and maintain comprehensive documentation of the platform for relevant stakeholders (e.g. developers and others).
- Improve the sandbox and REPL (Real-Eval-Print Loop) experience of the platform.
- Release version 0.0.16 of the platform.

#### Milestone 3
- Provide a Visual Studio Code plugin for origination and tests.
- Ongoing maintenance of the platform for one year (beyond grant duration), which includes that the Recipient will keep Chinstrap up to date with the Tezos protocol and address any issues raised by the community.
- Communicate and advertise the platform on social media and other appropriate channels.
